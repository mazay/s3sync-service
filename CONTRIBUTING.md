# Contributing

All inputs are valuable, thank you for taking the time to influence the project!

You are welcome to use the following ways of contribution:
* Report a bug
* Submit a fix
* Propose new features
* Become a maintainer

**If you feel like this guideline should be updated - feel free to file a pull request.**

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed some functionality, update the documentation.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/mazay/s3sync-service/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/mazay/s3sync-service/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
  * Be specific
  * Give sample configuration
  * Share your environment details (OS, versions, etc.)
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* The code style is inspired by the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments), please tend to use the same approach.
* Make use of [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) to automatically fix the majority style issues.
* The code should be [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) compliant in order to pass the automatic checks.
