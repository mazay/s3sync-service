# s3sync-service

The `s3sync-service` is a lightweight application designed to sync multiple local paths with configured [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) locations (known as _sites_) in realtime - your data getting synced upon change!

You can either use one [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html) and multiple bucket paths to store your data, or different S3 buckets under one AWS account or even different S3 buckets under different AWS accounts hosted in different [AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html).

There are a variety of options for running the `s3sync-service`:

- [here](running-locally.md) is described how to run it locally
- [this page](running-in-docker.md) has guidelines for running it in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- and [our favourite recipe](running-on-k8s.md) for running it on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

Feel free to check [how it works](how-it-works.md) in more details or familiarise yourself with available [configuration](configuration.md) options.
